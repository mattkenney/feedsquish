Feedsquish is based on an earlier project called Feedsqueeze.

Feedsquish uses:
1. Universal Feed Parser, http://www.feedparser.org/, by Mark Pilgrim
2. Beautiful Soup, http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/, by Leonard
   Richardson
3. py-dom-xpath, http://code.google.com/p/py-dom-xpath/
4. Yapps 2, http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/yapps/, by Amit J. Patel.

A version of Yapps 2 is included here for convenience because pip install
failed.
